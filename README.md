(1) API and requests

API or Application Programming interface is a bridge between software applications. The use of APIs constitute requests and calls, which in our case is callable data.
We obtain information from our API by using requests, and call certain features of that request to access specified information. For example, if I wanted to search a webpage
using an API and I only want pictures of cats then my request would come in the form of a recognisiable tag or a TOKEN. TOKENs define specified categorical parameters which narrow the scope of that request. So in our example, say convenienently the webpage sorts all cat pictures under one TOKEN, we only need to find out what this TOKEN is to form a request which obtains only cat pictures.
